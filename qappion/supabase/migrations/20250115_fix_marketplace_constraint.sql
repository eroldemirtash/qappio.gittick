-- Fix marketplace constraint to allow custom marketplace names
-- Run this in Supabase Studio â†’ SQL Editor

-- Drop the existing check constraint
ALTER TABLE public.product_marketplaces

-- Add a new constraint that allows any text (or keep it flexible)
-- We can either remove the constraint entirely or make it more flexible
-- For now, let's remove it to allow any marketplace name

-- Verify the constraint is removed
